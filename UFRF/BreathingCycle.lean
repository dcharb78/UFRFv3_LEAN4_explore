# UFRF.BreathingCycle (Upgraded to ZMod Ring)

**Theorem 2: The 13-Position Breathing Cycle**

The Trinity's three LOG grades generate exactly 13 positions:
- Positions 1–3: Log1 (Linear phase)
- Positions 4–6: Log2 (Curved phase)
- **Position 6.5: Critical Flip** (boundary between expansion and contraction)
- Positions 7–9: Log3 (Cubed phase)
- Position 10: REST (maximum coherence)
- Positions 11–12: Bridge (scale transition)
- Position 13: Seed (= Position 1 of next cycle)

## Design: ZMod vs Fin

We use `ZMod` instead of `Fin` because the cycle is a **Topological Ring**.
Movement is modular: Position 13 is not "out of bounds" — it IS Position 0.
The `bridge_seed_wraps` theorem `(12 + 1 = 0)` becomes definitional.

For **indexing/addressing**, `Fin` is still used in `Addressing.lean` and
`NumberBases.lean`. When computing the *Phase* of an address, cast via
`(digit : ZMod 13)`.

## Key Properties
- The flip at 6.5 divides EXPANSION (1–6) from CONTRACTION (7–13)
- Bridge positions (11–13) become Seed positions (1–3) of the next scale
- Position 10 (REST) is the point of maximum stability → Base 10
- Position 13 loops to Position 1 → toroidal topology (axiomatic in ZMod)

The REST position (index 9 = position 10) is the unique point of maximum
coherence. It is the last position before the bridge phase begins.
-/
def restPosition : CyclePos := (9 : CyclePos)

/--
The Seed position (index 12 = position 13) maps to position 1 of the next cycle.
This is the toroidal identification that closes the loop.

The entry position (index 0 = position 1).
-/
def entryPosition : CyclePos := (0 : CyclePos)

/-! ### Ring Topology Theorems -/

/--
**Bridge-Seed Continuity (Automatic)**
Because CyclePos is a ZMod ring, adding 1 to the last position (12)
automatically returns to the entry position (0).
In `Fin 13` this required manual `%`; in `ZMod 13` it is *definitional*.

**Inversion Symmetry**
In a balanced 13-cycle, the Flip (6.5) roughly corresponds to the
additive inverse. In ZMod 13: 6 + 7 = 13 ≡ 0.

/--
**Full Cycle Return**
Any position plus 13 returns to itself (periodicity).
This is automatic in ZMod 13 since 13 ≡ 0.

/-! ### Continuous Geometry -/

/--
The 6.5 flip divides the cycle into equal halves on the continuous manifold,
even though the discrete position count is asymmetric (6 expansion + 7 contraction).
The continuous flip point maps to exactly 1/2 of the unit interval.

(the boundaries between LOG phases and structural transitions).

/-! ### Continuous-to-Discrete Mapping (Phase Bins) -/

/--
A continuous time `t` belongs to the discrete position `n`
if it falls within the half-open interval [n - 0.5, n + 0.5).
This rigorously maps the continuous manifold to discrete states.

  (n : ℝ) - 0.5 ≤ t ∧ t < (n : ℝ) + 0.5

/-! ### PRISM: Algebraic Time Generation

The PRISM experiment proves that the breathing cycle is **self-driving**.
Two static symmetries (Inversion and Reflection) compose to produce the
Successor function. No external clock is needed.

`neg(comp(x)) = x + 1`

Geometry (Foundation) + Algebra (PRISM) = Dynamics (Breathing).

**PRISM Operator: Complement (Inversion)**
The inversion of a state relative to the cycle maximum.
In ZMod N, this is `-(x + 1)` or equivalently `(-x) - 1`.
-/
def comp (x : CyclePos) : CyclePos := -x - 1

/--
**PRISM Operator: Negation (Reflection)**
The reflection of a state across the zero point.
-/
def neg (x : CyclePos) : CyclePos := -x

/--
**Theorem: Symmetries Generate Time (The PRISM Identity)**
Applying Complement then Negation produces the Successor (Time Tick).
`neg (comp x) = x + 1`

This proves that Time is an emergent property of static symmetries.
The cycle drives itself through the interaction of Inversion and Reflection.
