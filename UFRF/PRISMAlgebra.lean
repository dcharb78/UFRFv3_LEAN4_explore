**PRISM Algebraic Structure of ℤ/(13ⁿ)ℤ**

This module formalizes the algebraic findings from the PRISM experiment,
which revealed that the multiplicative and additive structure of ℤ/13ℤ
encodes the breathing cycle's core operations:

## Key Results

1. **Primitive Root**: 2 generates (ℤ/13ℤ)* with order 12 = φ(13).
   Binary computation naturally traverses the full 13-cycle.

2. **α⁻¹ in Native Geometry**: 137 = 7 + 10×13 in base 13.
   The fine structure constant's lowest digit is 7 (contraction start),
   which is itself a primitive root of 13.

3. **Scale Projection**: The canonical map ℤ/(13²)ℤ → ℤ/13ℤ is a ring
   homomorphism. Operations at higher scales project faithfully to lower.

4. **Odd Cycle**: 13ⁿ is always odd, forcing the midpoint 6.5 to be
   forever fractional — the algebraic origin of Re(s) = 1/2.

5. **COMP/NEG Asymmetry**: comp (x ↦ 12-x) is digit-local,
   neg (x ↦ -x) has inter-digit carries. Their composition is succ.

/-! ### Finding 2: Binary is the Generator -/

/--
**2 generates the full multiplicative group (ℤ/13ℤ)*.**

The multiplicative order of 2 modulo 13 is 12 = φ(13).
This means binary powers {2⁰, 2¹, ..., 2¹¹} hit all 12
non-zero residues mod 13 before cycling.

Consequence: standard binary computation naturally traverses
the complete breathing cycle.

137 = 7 + 10 × 13 + 0 × 169

Digit 0 (units): 7 = contraction start (first post-flip position)
Digit 1 (13s):  10 = REST position

breathing cycle, lands at Phase 7 — the first contraction position.

**7 is a primitive root of 13.**

7¹² ≡ 1 (mod 13) and no smaller power of 7 equals 1.
So α⁻¹ mod 13 itself generates the full multiplicative cycle.

/-! ### Finding 4: Scale Projection Ring Homomorphism -/

/--
**Scale projection ℤ/(13²)ℤ → ℤ/13ℤ is a ring homomorphism.**

The canonical map preserves addition and multiplication.
Operations at scale 2 project faithfully to scale 1.
This uses Mathlib's `ZMod.castHom` which directly provides
the ring homomorphism when the moduli divide.

**Neg commutes with scale projection.**

For any x in ℤ/(13²)ℤ, negating then projecting equals
projecting then negating. This is immediate from the
ring homomorphism property.

/-! ### Finding 5: Odd Cycle Forces Fractional Midpoint -/

/--
**13ⁿ is always odd for n ≥ 1.**

Since 13 is odd, all its powers are odd. Therefore 13ⁿ/2 is
never an integer — the midpoint 6.5 is algebraically forced
to be fractional at every scale depth.

This is the algebraic origin of Re(s) = 1/2: the critical
line is forced because the cycle length can never be evenly halved.

**The comp fixed point is 6 at scale 1.**

comp(x) = 12 - x, so comp(6) = 6. The flip boundary falls
between 6 (last expansion) and 7 (first contraction).

/-! ### Finding 1: COMP/NEG Composition is Successor -/

/--
**neg ∘ comp = succ in ℤ/13ℤ.**

comp(x) = 12 - x (digit-local, no carries)
neg(x) = -x (has inter-digit carries at higher scales)
neg(comp(x)) = -(12 - x) = x - 12 = x + 1 (mod 13)

This is the algebraic reason the expansion (scale-local) and
contraction (cross-scale) phases compose to give the successor
— the fundamental forward step of the breathing cycle.

/-! ### Prime Dual-Nature: Context Creators vs Context Participants

Every number exists in infinitely many modular contexts (ℤ/mℤ for all m).
But **primes create their own context**: ℤ/pℤ is a field.
Non-primes cannot do this — ℤ/nℤ for composite n has zero divisors.

The UFRF primes {2, 3, 7, 13, 137} each play both roles:
- **Context creator**: each defines a field ℤ/pℤ
- **Context participant**: each lives as an element in ℤ/13ℤ

The critical insight: **13 = 0 in ℤ/13ℤ**. The prime that creates the
breathing cycle is the **void** within its own context. It is the
observer that cannot observe itself.
-/

/--
**All UFRF-relevant primes create fields.**

Each of {2, 3, 7, 13, 137} is prime, so ℤ/pℤ is a field
with no zero divisors and full multiplicative invertibility.

**UFRF primes as participants in ℤ/13ℤ.**

2, 3, and 7 are all non-zero in ℤ/13ℤ — they participate
as active elements. But 13 ≡ 0: the modulus vanishes in
its own field.

/--
**The Observer Paradox: 13 vanishes in its own context.**

The prime that creates the breathing cycle (ℤ/13ℤ) maps to
zero within that very cycle. It IS the modular void — the
position from which structure is observed but which has no
position itself.

/--
**137 inherits 7's generation power.**

137 ≡ 7 (mod 13), so α⁻¹ participates in the breathing cycle
with the same multiplicative properties as 7 (a primitive root).
The fine structure constant doesn't just land on Phase 7 — it IS
Phase 7 algebraically.

**Trinity subgroup: 3 generates the cube roots of unity.**

3³ ≡ 1 (mod 13), so 3 has multiplicative order 3 in ℤ/13ℤ.
Unlike 2 and 7 (primitive roots with order 12), 3 generates
only the subgroup {1, 3, 9}. This partitions the 12 non-zero
elements into 4 cosets of size 3 — a four-fold symmetry
within the multiplicative group, reflecting the Trinity's role
as a structural divider rather than a full generator.

/-! ## Adelic Resolution: One Ring, Many Depths

Not many rings. ONE ring. Every prime provides a different COMPLETION
of it — a different depth of view. p=3 sees broad strokes.
p=7 sees more detail. p=137 sees exquisite fine grain.
All primes simultaneously = the full adele = infinite resolution.

This is the adelic perspective: the projection tower

    ℤ/13³ℤ → ℤ/13²ℤ → ℤ/13ℤ

isn't a hierarchy of DIFFERENT structures. It's the SAME ring
viewed at increasing resolution. The inverse limit ℤ₁₃ = lim← ℤ/13ⁿℤ
IS the ring at infinite 13-adic resolution.

Cross-prime views (mod 3, mod 7, mod 13) are independent completions
of the SAME integer ring ℤ. By CRT, seeing the ring at multiple
prime resolutions simultaneously gives more information than any
single prime alone — without ever leaving the one ring.

"Dimensions" aren't new directions. They're deeper resolution.
That's why PCA eigenvalues are flat: adding dimensions adds depth,
not new independent structure.
-/

/--
**The Projection Tower Composes.**

The projection ℤ/13³ℤ → ℤ/13ℤ factors through ℤ/13²ℤ.
Going from high resolution to low resolution in one step
equals going through an intermediate resolution.

This is the adelic coherence condition: all depths of the
one ring are mutually consistent.

**Cross-prime independence (Chinese Remainder).**

**Resolution depth preserves addition.**

At every depth, addition in the one ring projects faithfully.
(a + b) seen at depth n = (a at depth n) + (b at depth n).

Calculus works BECAUSE of this. Fourier works BECAUSE of this.

/-! ## CRT Ring Isomorphism: The Adelic Decomposition

The Chinese Remainder Theorem gives not just a cardinality match
but a RING ISOMORPHISM. This is the formal statement that viewing
the one ring at two different prime depths gives algebraically
independent information — and you can reconstruct the original.

This is the adelic decomposition made rigorous: different primes
provide different COMPLETIONS of the same ring, and the CRT
guarantees these completions are independent.
