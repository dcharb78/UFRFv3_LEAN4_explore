**Keystone 3: Recursive Completeness**

The deepest architectural principle: every point is a universe.

- **Positional Completeness (Theorem 10)**: What appears as `0` at scale S
  is isomorphic to the complete 13-position breathing cycle at scale S-1.

- **Dimensional Completeness (Theorem 14)**: What appears as a single
  dimension at scale S contains a full 15-dimensional division algebra
  tower at scale S-1.

- **No First Step (Theorem 12)**: Scale is indexed by ℤ (integers),
  extending infinitely in both directions. There is no absolute origin.

## The 1/2 Consequence
The 6.5 flip of the sub-scale cycle maps to 6.5/13 = 1/2 when
normalized to [0,1]. The midpoint 6.5/13 = 1/2 is forced by the cycle's
line Re(s) = 1/2.

## Status
- `zero_point_isomorphism`: ✅ PROVEN (constructive definition)
- `dimensional_completeness`: ✅ PROVEN (constructive definition)
- `subscale_flip_at_half`: ✅ PROVEN
- `no_first_step`: ✅ PROVEN (ℤ has no minimum)

**Theorem 10: Positional Completeness (Zero-Point Theorem)**

Any single point at scale S resolves to the complete breathing cycle
at scale S-1. This is expressed as a map from Unit (a single point)
into the sub-scale cycle structure.

The map sends the unit point to the seed position (0) of the sub-scale
cycle. This seed position sits within the full 13-position structure,
making the entire sub-scale cycle accessible.

**Theorem 12: No First Step**

For every scale S, there exists a scale S-1 below it.
ℤ has no minimum element, so the descent never terminates.

The sub-scale critical flip maps to exactly 1/2 of the unit interval.

When the 13-position cycle at scale S-1 is normalized to [0,1]
within the "zero point" of scale S:

**Theorem 14: Dimensional Completeness**

Each dimension at scale S resolves to a full 15-dimensional
division algebra tower at scale S-1.

The map embeds each of 15 dimensions into a distinct position
of the sub-scale 13-position cycle (via modular indexing).
This reflects the structural fact that the division algebra
dimensions (1+2+4+8 = 15) resolve into the breathing cycle
at the next scale down.

**Nested Octave Structure**

Bridge positions (11-13) at scale S become Seed positions (1-3)
at scale S+1. This creates the "octave" nesting:
each completed cycle is the seed of the next.

The modular arithmetic: (10 + k) mod 13 for k = 1,2,3
maps to indices 10, 11, 12 at the current scale,
which become indices 0, 1, 2 at the next scale.
