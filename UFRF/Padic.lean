**The Universal Prime Tower: One Principle, All Primes**

Every prime p generates its own p-adic tower:
  ℤ/p³ℤ → ℤ/p²ℤ → ℤ/pℤ → ... → ℤ_[p]

The organizing principle is the SAME at every prime:
1. Projection: ring homomorphisms preserve addition and multiplication
2. Conservation: if a + b + c = 0 at infinite depth, then
   π(a) + π(b) + π(c) = 0 at every finite depth
3. Resolution: higher powers see more, |ℤ/pⁿℤ| = pⁿ

13 is not a privileged number — it's a STRUCTURAL POSITION.
It's where the UFRF breathing cycle lands: the cycle length
that emerges from the simplicial + golden ratio derivation.
But the tower machinery works identically at p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, ...

Different primes see INDEPENDENT completions of the same ring ℤ
(proven via CRT in PRISMAlgebra). They don't conflict —
they're orthogonal views. The UFRF picks p = 13 not because
13 is special as a number, but because 13 is where the
structure positions itself.

## Architecture
- Section `UniversalTower`: parametric in any prime p
- Section `UFRFSpecialization`: p = 13 as the UFRF's position

/-! ## Universal Tower: The Organizing Principle

These theorems are parametric in ANY prime p. They prove
that the projection/conservation/resolution structure is
a property of primes themselves, not of 13 specifically.

**Every prime generates a projection to its cycle ring.**

For any prime p, there exists a ring homomorphism from the
p-adic integers ℤ_[p] to the finite cycle ring ℤ/pℤ.

This is universal — the same construction at every prime.
13 doesn't get special treatment.

**Every prime generates a tower of arbitrary depth.**

**Conservation is universal.**

If three elements sum to zero in ℤ_[p] — at ANY prime p —
their projections sum to zero in ℤ/pℤ.

This is not a fact about 13. It's a fact about ring homomorphisms.
Conservation propagates because projection preserves addition.
That's the organizing principle.

**Addition preservation is universal.**

For any prime p: π(a + b) = π(a) + π(b).
This is why calculus works at every scale — the derivative

the additive structure. Scale-invariant.

/--
**Multiplication preservation is universal.**

For any prime p: π(a · b) = π(a) · π(b).
Ring homomorphisms preserve BOTH operations.
The multiplicative structure of the one ring is
visible at every resolution, at every prime.

**Unity preservation is universal.**

For any prime p: π(1) = 1. The multiplicative identity
of the infinite ring maps to the multiplicative identity
of the cycle ring. Scale doesn't change what "one" is.

/-! ## UFRF Specialization: p = 13 as Structural Position

The UFRF's breathing cycle has length 13. This isn't because
13 is a magic number — it's because the simplicial topology
(4 from tetrahedra) combined with the golden ratio (√φ from
Kepler's triangle) yields exactly 4√φ ≈ 5.088..., and the
derived cycle structure (Foundation.lean) produces 13 positions.

Below, we specialize the universal tower to p = 13.
Everything above applies equally to p = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...

The organizing principle requires primality. 13 being prime

/-! ## Multi-Prime Independence

Different primes create DIFFERENT towers for the SAME ring.
The CRT (proven in PRISMAlgebra) shows these views are
algebraically independent.

We prove: what you see at p = 3, and what you see at p = 7,
and what you see at p = 13 — are three orthogonal projections
of a single element. No information overlap.

**Three primes, three independent conservation laws.**

If a + b + c = 0 holds as integers, then:
- conservation at p = 3:  a + b + c = 0 in ℤ/3ℤ
- conservation at p = 7:  a + b + c = 0 in ℤ/7ℤ
- conservation at p = 13: a + b + c = 0 in ℤ/13ℤ

Three independent views. Same law. Same ring.
CRT guarantees no information overlap.

**137 lives at three positions simultaneously.**

The fine structure constant α⁻¹ ≈ 137 is not at ONE
position in the one ring. It has a DIFFERENT face at
each prime:
- At p = 3: 137 looks like 2 (coarse, 3 bins)
- At p = 7: 137 looks like 4 (medium, 7 bins)
- At p = 13: 137 looks like 7 (fine, 13 bins)

Same element. Three independent phase spaces.
Each prime's tower sees it differently.
