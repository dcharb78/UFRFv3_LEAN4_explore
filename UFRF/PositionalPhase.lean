# UFRF.PositionalPhase

**Position vs Accounting: Phase from Prime Values**

From the Ideas folder (conversation.txt, lines ~836–976):
The fundamental error in conventional analysis is using array
indices (accounting) instead of prime values (position) for phase offsets.

The phase for prime p on the 13-cycle is `p/13 × 2π`.
This is POSITIONAL — it comes from where the prime IS, not
which slot it occupies in a list.

**The Golden Angle Discovery:**
Position 5 gives phase 5/13 of the full circle.
5/13 ≈ 0.38462... ≈ 1/φ² ≈ 0.38197...

The golden angle (137.508°) is 1/φ² of the full circle (360°).
So 5/13 ≈ 1/φ² — the golden angle EMERGES from position 5's
geometric phase. It was never imposed. It was always there.

**Positional phase of prime p on the 13-cycle.**

The phase is p/13 of the full circle. This is the prime's
GEOMETRIC position, not its index in a list.

Each prime has a distinct phase. Note how they span the circle
non-uniformly — the spacing IS the geometry.

**The golden ratio reciprocal squared.**

1/φ² = (3 - √5) / 2. This is the fraction of the circle
corresponding to the golden angle (≈ 137.508°).

**Position 5 approximates 1/φ² with error < 0.003.**

|5/13 - 1/φ²| < 0.003

This is the key emergence result: the golden angle isn't imposed
on the 13-cycle. It appears BECAUSE prime 5 sits at position 5,
and 5/13 happens to be within 0.27% of 1/φ².

The golden angle was always encoded in the cycle geometry.
We just couldn't see it because we were using accounting (index 2
in the prime list) instead of position (value 5 in the cycle).

**The five cycle primes have distinct positional phases.**

No two primes share the same position in the cycle.
This is trivially true since distinct primes have distinct

**The observer's positional phase is exactly 1 (= 0, full circle).**

Prime 13 at position 13 has phase 13/13 = 1 ≡ 0.
The observer completes the full circle and returns to the origin.
This is the algebraic counterpart of `observer_is_void` in PRISMAlgebra:
(13 : ZMod 13) = 0.
